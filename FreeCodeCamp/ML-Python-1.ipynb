    "2. **Machine Learning (ML)**: \n",
    "   - ML is a subset of AI.\n",
    "   - It focuses on algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to learn from and make predictions based on data.\n",

    "3. **Deep Learning (DL)**: \n",
    "   - DL is a subset of ML.\n",
    "   - It involves neural networks with many layers (hence \"deep\") that are designed to learn from large amounts of data.\n",

    "- **AI** is the umbrella term that includes all intelligent machine technologies.\n",
    "- **ML** is a specific area within AI that uses data-driven techniques to improve performance.\n",
    "- **DL** is a specialized branch within ML that uses complex neural networks to achieve high levels of learning and accuracy.\n"
